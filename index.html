      To assist with the issue compliance aids have been devised, tested and employed.
Typically, compliance aids have been classified into three categories; pill holders
(Corlett, 1996), alarm-based aids (Szeto & Giles, 1997) and monitoring devices (Wertheimer
& Santella, 2003). The latter of these are the most elaborate and form part of an integrated
care model whereby the patient’s adherence to their medication regime can be monitored
remotely (e.g., via an Internet-based care model) and alarms issued in instances of noncompliance
as a means of reminder. These systems facilitate the collation of unlimited
information regarding the patient’s compliance and hence provide for the means of data
analysis. For example, for a given patient, analysis of their data may show that due to their
lifestyle they repeatedly miss their medication dosages on Friday afternoons and
Saturday nights. For a different patient, analysis may show that they have high levels
of non-compliance during periods at which they may be at work. The resultant information
can be used to readjust the medication regimen in instances of non-compliance. This
is a complex procedure and must take into consideration the patient’s ailment, their entire
medication regime and the impact that missing one medication may have on the remainder
of medications and the point in time when the medication must be taken, for example,
before meals.

      <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;">
      Qualitative and quantitative TR (as previously outlined) may be employed in this
instance whereby a set of formal rules can be established and used to control the
underlying principles by which a patient’s medication regime must be altered to accommodate
for instances of non-compliance. For example, a decision support system running
on the central Internet-based server monitoring patient’s compliance at home may have
the following (hypothetical) rule set:

      <h1><u>Example 3: Hospital Management of Bed Occupancy</u></h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;">
      The estimation of the length of stay of patients in hospitals is important for patient
treatment management, bed occupancy management and cost effectiveness measures.
Mathematical models have been produced as decision aids in this area (McClean, 1994)
and in addition many trauma scores can be used to give an indication of patient survival
probability (Boyd, Tolson, & Cope, 1987) and severity of trauma indices (Champion,
Copes, & Sacco, 1990). All of this information along with demographic details, treatment,
physical and mental scores can be taken into consideration and used as means upon
which to generate a time to event measure, that is, prediction of length of stay in hospital.
This is a complex and multi-factorial problem, but nevertheless one worthy of further
attention. Qualitative and quantitative TR techniques may be used as the basis to model

      <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;">
      the time to event measures. These techniques can easily be integrated into a hospital
based administrative system operating on an intranet/Internet basis which collates
information from all in-patients and wards within a hospital environment, in addition to
having access to centralized patient information. It can thus accommodate for the
complex temporal nature of the problem through formalized approaches, for example:

          <h2><u>Future Trends</u></h2>
      </center>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;" >
      It is clear that the Internet will have a long-term role within healthcare applications. At
present its application and ability to improve upon current and existing healthcare
practices has shown its promise and already we are slowly witnessing its uptake. Many
of the drivers that will inevitably lead to success will come from governmental perspectives.
For example, in the United Kingdom the government has put at the forefront of its
healthcare organization agenda development and increased usage of Intranet and
Internet services (Tyrrell, 1999). Provision of access to clinical information via Internetbased
services allows not only access via common desktop PCs, but also through the
usage of mobile phones with Web browsers and personal digital assistants. Hence users
will no longer be geographically constrained and will be able to access information whilst
undertaking house calls or on a hospital ward. This concept is further extended through
the new and innovative research areas of Ambient Intelligence, Context-Aware Computing,
User Profiling and Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (ERCIM News, 2001) where
networks and interoperable communication infrastructures, along with intelligent processing
of information gathered have evolved as the next generation of services which
could further support this area.
      
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;">
      In general, the role of ICT within healthcare will change the way in which patients interact
with healthcare professionals and also the way in which healthcare professionals interact
with each other. It is not unreasonable to consider that patients may be able to access
information via the Internet in the future and self-diagnose based on their symptoms
(Tyrrell, 1999). In addition, the recent success of sensor and textile technologies,
wearable vital sign monitors and home based medical devices for self assessment make
self-recording a possibility and provide tangible clinical information to be used in selfdiagnosis.
For this to become reality, regional and national networks of high standing
will have to be established to ensure the integrity of the information and processes to
which the patient may have access. From the healthcare professional’s point of view, the
Internet offers the future role of high quality information provision. This will provide

      enhanced access to new and evolving techniques, medical conditions and online
learning capabilities. All of which will greater inform the healthcare professionals
resulting in an overall improved level in healthcare quality.

      <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;" >
      From a more general perspective, the Internet has the ability to connect, on a global scale
patients and healthcare professionals during consultation processes. For example, a
patient may request a diagnosis directly from any private based clinic in the world, or on
a “pay-per-use” basis, exploit the e-commerce nature of the Internet and decrease waiting
times for private examinations or treatments. Although these scenarios are not unrealistic
to consider, it must be appreciated that the term “the Internet” as a means to provide them
all is a large scale underestimation of the complexity of the underlying processes. A
multitude of components such as communication bandwidth, mobile communication
infrastructures, security, interoperability, transmission protocols, information exchange
standards, and decision support modules will all have a role to play. Considering the
latter, which has been the main thrust of the current work, establishes the need to further
improve upon existing approaches.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;">
      It is envisaged that efforts will continue to provide solutions, from a TR perspective,
which can accommodate for the temporal nature of healthcare based information. Recent
studies (Shahar, 1999; Augusto, 2003a) have identified several key areas of TR to be
explored to provide more accurate and useful automated assistance in healthcare. Here
we have covered general aspects while more specific and technical coverage is given in
Augusto & Nugent (2004). Some of the tools and the information required for the medical
practice is shared between the traditional scenario and the Internet-based approach to
diagnosis as discussed above. However, this article attempts to illustrate that while TR
remains an important concept to be considered in Internet-based healthcare, the infrastructure
where it is applied and the interaction with this technology is substantially
different and will pose further unresolved challenges.
        </p>

      <h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
      </center>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;">
       It is evident that the way healthcare will be delivered in the future will involve the
utilization of ICT solutions, especially the Internet, to ensure a cost-effective means of
high quality of service. Coupled with this will be embedded automated medical decision
support systems offering the ability to analyze and interpret the plethora of clinical
information that can be acquired through such infrastructures and their data repositories.
This will inevitability result in both patients and healthcare professionals being presented
more often with ICT healthcare solutions resulting in a change in the way they
interact.
      </p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;">
The role of TR has been established and proven from a computer science perspective and
has attained applied success in many domains, including the assistance in medical
diagnosis and treatment. The last decade has witnessed a fruitful interaction between the
areas of TR and medicine and significant advances were made in time-related diagnosis
and therapy support. However, these advances were made under a different knowledge

      management paradigm and although we think they may provide a good starting point they
cannot be directly applied to Internet-based healthcare systems.
      </p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: normal;margin: inherit;">
      Given that there is a large “time” element associated with clinical information and the
opportunity to embed TR into the next generation of Internet-based healthcare, we
identify this as a potential prolific area for future developments and an opportunity to
identify “how” and “where” it can be applied. Specifically, it is our view that in the short
term TR will be a valuable asset in the provision of automated support during Internetbased
patient to healthcare professional consultations.
